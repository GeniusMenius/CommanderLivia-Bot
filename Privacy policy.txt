Commander Livia – Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2025

1. Overview

Commander Livia (“the Bot”, “the Service”) is a Discord bot developed and maintained by Tim Palm.
This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.

2. Data Collected

Commander Livia stores only minimal data necessary for functionality related to event participation and squad organization.

The following information may be stored locally on the bot host:

Discord User ID (unique numeric identifier)

Discord display name (as shown in the server)

RSVP status (attending / not attending)

Selected class, elite specialization, and role for WvW or PvE events

Timestamps for when you last interacted with the bot

No additional data such as messages, email addresses, or IP addresses are stored or tracked.

3. Purpose of Data

The collected data is used solely to:

Display RSVP lists and event summaries

Build and analyze WvW squad compositions

Export or report event statistics on command (for admin users only)

Maintain event participation between bot restarts

The data is never shared, sold, or used for advertising.

4. Data Storage

All data is stored locally on the server running Commander Livia, typically in small JSON files (or a future SQLite database).
There is no external or cloud-based database connection.
Server owners are responsible for maintaining the security of their own environment.

5. Data Retention

RSVP data is automatically deleted after a defined period (default: 7 days) of inactivity.
Admins may also reset or clear data manually via bot commands (/event reset, /wvw_event reset, etc.).

6. Your Rights

You have the right to:

Request that your data be deleted from the bot’s local storage

Revoke consent by removing the bot from a server

Contact the developer for clarification or manual removal of stored data

Requests can be made by messaging the bot owner directly or via the official support channels.

7. Third Parties

Commander Livia does not use third-party analytics, tracking tools, or external APIs that transmit personal data.
Only the official Discord API is used, following Discord’s Developer Terms
.

8. Security

All data operations are handled locally and securely.
The developer applies reasonable technical and administrative measures to protect against unauthorized access, corruption, or misuse of data.

9. Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated over time to reflect feature changes or compliance requirements.
Users are encouraged to review it periodically. The “Last updated” date at the top will indicate any revisions.
